## 🍷 Core Features Designed

### 1. Time-Based Wine Club
```
Customer buys $90 → Bronze (10% for 3 months)
Customer buys $180 → Silver (15% for 6 months from original date!)
Customer upgrades early → Gets full new duration
Customer doesn't purchase → Expires, must restart
```

### 2. Loyalty Points (After 1 Year)
```
365+ days member → Starts earning points
Active membership → Keep earning
Membership expires → Stop earning, keep points
Points never expire
Redeem for: Merch (anytime), Events (anytime), Wine (point sales only)
```

### 3. CRM Integration
```
Create stage in LiberVino → Create discount in C7/Shopify
Customer enrolls → Add to discount eligibility list
Discount auto-applies → Customer shops with automatic savings
Customer upgrades → Remove from old, add to new discount
Customer expires → Daily cron removes from discount
```

### 4. Automated Communications
```
Monthly (1st of month) → Send status email/SMS
7 days before expiration → Send warning
Customizable templates → Mailchimp, Klaviyo, RedChirp
Track opens, clicks, deliveries → Full audit trail
```

## 🎨 Unique Design Decisions

### 1. Dollar-Based, Not Bottle-Based
**Why:** Different bottle sizes, simpler qualification, CRM handles product rules

### 2. Original Date Preservation on Upgrades
**Why:** Rewards early upgraders, creates urgency, fair to customers

### 3. Points After 1 Year
**Why:** Rewards true loyalty, compound benefits, encourages retention

### 4. CRM Manages Product Rules
**Why:** Don't duplicate logic, flexibility per winery, native CRM features

### 5. No User Login Needed
**Why:** Embedded in CRM admin, wineries already authenticated

### 6. Points for Wine Only in Sales
**Why:** Protects wine pricing integrity, creates special events

### 7. Multi-Provider Communication
**Why:** Use what wineries already have, flexibility, no lock-in
