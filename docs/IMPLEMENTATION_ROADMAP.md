## 🎯 Core Features Designed

### 1. Time-Based Discount Club ✅

**How it works:**
- Customers purchase → Enroll in stage (Bronze/Silver/Gold)
- Get discount for duration (3/6/12 months)
- Can renew (same stage) or upgrade (higher stage)
- Upgrades calculated from original enrollment date
- Must purchase within timeframe or expire

**Example:**
```
Jan 1: Buy $90 → Bronze (10% for 3 months, expires April 1)
Feb 1: Buy $180 → Upgrade to Silver
Expiration: Jan 1 + 6 months = July 1 (gained 3 months!)
```

### 2. Loyalty Points System ✅

**How it works:**
- Earn points after 365 cumulative membership days
- Dollar-based earning (configurable per winery)
- Points earned on the qualifying 365-day purchase!
- Must maintain active membership to keep earning
- If membership expires, keep points but stop earning
- Need another 365 days to resume earning

**Redemption:**
- ✅ Merchandise - anytime
- ✅ Events - anytime
- ✅ Tastings - anytime
- ⚠️ Wine - only during special point sales (protects pricing)

### 3. CRM Integration ✅

**Customer Sync:**
- Upsert customers to CRM (Mailchimp/Klaviyo style)
- Get crm_id back and store
- Add to discount eligibility list in CRM
- Remove when enrollment expires

**Discount Management:**
- One discount code per stage in CRM
- Add/remove customers from eligibility lists
- Discounts auto-apply at checkout
- Product rules managed in CRM

### 4. Automated Communications ✅

**Monthly Status Emails:**
- Current stage & discount
- Days remaining
- Minimum purchase to renew
- Upgrade opportunities
- Loyalty points balance
- Suggested wines (future AI)
- Custom winery content
