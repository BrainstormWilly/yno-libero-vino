## Overview

This package contains **5 professionally designed email templates** for Mailchimp, each optimized for specific membership communication scenarios:

1. **Monthly Status** - Regular updates on membership status, benefits, and opportunities
2. **Expiration Warning** - Alerts sent before membership expiration
3. **Expiration Notice** - Final notice when membership expires

## Mailchimp Variable Syntax

LiberoVino templates use Mailchimp's standard merge tag format: **`*|UPPERCASE_TAG|*`**

All merge tags correspond to merge fields in your Mailchimp audience and are automatically populated when LiberoVino sends data to Mailchimp via API integration.

### Example Usage

```html
Hello *|CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME|*,

Your membership with *|CLIENT_NAME|* expires on *|EXPIRATION_FORMATTED|*.
```

This will render as:
```
Hello John,

Your membership with Liberty Wines expires on Jun 23, 2026.
```

## Setting Up Mailchimp Automations

### Step 1: Upload Templates to Mailchimp

1. Log in to your Mailchimp account
2. Navigate to **Templates** → **Create Template**
3. For each template file:
   - Click **Create Template** → **Code Your Own**
   - Copy the HTML from the template file
   - Paste into the HTML editor
   - Save and name the template (e.g., "LiberoVino Monthly Status")

### Step 2: Create Merge Fields

Before creating automations, ensure your Mailchimp audience has the following custom merge fields set up. These will be populated automatically when LiberoVino sends data to Mailchimp:

**Required Merge Fields:**
- `CLIENT_NAME` (Text)
- `CUSTOMER_FIRST_NAME` (Text)
- `EXPIRATION_FORMATTED` (Text)
- `SHOP_URL` (URL)

**Conditional Merge Fields** (used based on membership status):
- `IS_EXTENDED` (Text or Number)
- `HAS_UPGRADE` (Text or Number)
- `IS_EXPIRED` (Text or Number)
- `DAYS_REMAINING` (Number)
- `CURRENT_DISCOUNT_PERCENTAGE` (Number)

To create merge fields:
1. Navigate to **Audience** → **Settings** → **Audience fields and |*MERGE*| tags**
2. Click **Add a field**
3. Add each required field with the tag name in uppercase (e.g., `CLIENT_NAME`)

### Step 3: Create Automations

1. Navigate to **Automations** → **Create Automation**
2. Choose the appropriate trigger for each template:
   - **Monthly Status**: Set up an event-based automation (triggered via API)
   - **Expiration Warning**: Set up an event-based automation (triggered X days before expiration)
   - **Expiration Notice**: Set up an event-based automation (triggered on expiration date)
   - **Tier Upgrade**: Set up an event-based automation (triggered when upgrade becomes available)
   - **Club Signup**: Set up a subscriber-based automation (triggered when new member joins)

### Step 4: Configure Email Step

When building your automation:

1. Add the **Email** step
2. Select the corresponding template
3. Mailchimp will automatically recognize `*|TAG|*` merge tags
4. Ensure all required merge tags are mapped to your custom merge fields
5. Test the email to verify merge tags populate correctly

### Step 5: Test Your Automation

1. Use Mailchimp's **Test** feature to preview emails with sample data
2. Verify all merge tags populate correctly
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Send test emails to yourself before going live
5. Ensure members are in "subscribed" status for automations to trigger

## Integration with LiberoVino

### API Integration

LiberoVino integrates with Mailchimp via API to trigger automations when membership events occur:

- **Monthly Status Updates**: Sent automatically each month via API event
- **Expiration Warnings**: Sent based on your configured warning days via API event
- **Expiration Notices**: Sent when membership expires via API event
- **Upgrade Opportunities**: Sent when tier upgrades become available via API event
- **New Member Signups**: Sent when customers join the club via API event

**Note:** Mailchimp automations are triggered by events sent via the Mailchimp API. LiberoVino uses the `trackEvent` method to trigger automations and update member data.

### Setting Up the Integration

1. In your LiberoVino account, navigate to **Settings** → **Communication**
2. Select **Mailchimp** as your email provider
3. Enter your Mailchimp API key and Audience ID
4. Configure which automations should be triggered automatically
5. Test the integration by sending a test event

**Important:** Ensure your Mailchimp audience members are in "subscribed" status for automations to trigger. LiberoVino will update member status when sending events, but members must be subscribed to receive automated emails.

## Customization Tips

### Customizing Templates

While the templates are ready to use, you can customize them to match your brand:

1. **Header Images**: Replace the default header image with your winery's branding
2. **Colors**: Adjust color schemes to match your brand guidelines
3. **Content**: Modify text content while keeping merge tag placeholders intact
4. **Layout**: Adjust spacing and layout as needed (maintain mobile responsiveness)

### Best Practices

- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test templates with real data before going live
- **Mobile First**: Templates are mobile-responsive, but preview on multiple devices
- **Merge Tag Validation**: Ensure all required merge tags are populated before sending
- **Timing**: Set up automations to trigger at optimal times for your audience
- **Personalization**: Use customer names and personalized content to increase engagement
- **Member Status**: Ensure members are subscribed in Mailchimp for automations to trigger

### Handling Missing Variables

If a merge tag is not available for a specific member:

- Mailchimp will display the merge tag (e.g., `*|UPGRADE_AMOUNT_NEEDED|*`) if not set
- Use conditional logic in Mailchimp automations to handle optional merge tags
- Test with sample data to ensure graceful handling of missing values
