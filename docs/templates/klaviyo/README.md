## Overview

This package contains **5 professionally designed email templates** for Klaviyo, each optimized for specific membership communication scenarios:

1. **Monthly Status** - Regular updates on membership status, benefits, and opportunities

## Klaviyo Variable Syntax

LiberoVino templates use Klaviyo's standard variable format: **`{{person.variable_name}}`**

All variables are accessed through the `person` object, which represents the profile in your Klaviyo account. Variables are automatically populated when you send data from LiberoVino to Klaviyo via webhooks or API integration.

### Example Usage

```html
Hello {{person.customer_first_name}},

Your membership with {{person.client_name}} expires on {{person.expiration_formatted}}.
```

This will render as:
```
Hello John,

Your membership with Liberty Wines expires on Jun 23, 2026.
```

## Customization Tips

### Customizing Templates

While the templates are ready to use, you can customize them to match your brand:

1. **Header Images**: Replace the default header image with your winery's branding
2. **Colors**: Adjust color schemes to match your brand guidelines
3. **Content**: Modify text content while keeping variable placeholders intact
4. **Layout**: Adjust spacing and layout as needed (maintain mobile responsiveness)

### Best Practices

- **Test Thoroughly**: Always test templates with real data before going live
- **Mobile First**: Templates are mobile-responsive, but preview on multiple devices
- **Variable Validation**: Ensure all required variables are populated before sending
- **Timing**: Set up flows to send at optimal times for your audience
- **Personalization**: Use customer names and personalized content to increase engagement

### Handling Missing Variables

If a variable is not available for a specific person:

- Klaviyo will display the variable name (e.g., `{{person.upgrade_amount_needed}}`) if not set
- Use conditional logic in Klaviyo flows to handle optional variables
- Test with sample data to ensure graceful handling of missing values
