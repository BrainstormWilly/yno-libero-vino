> **Critical Reference**: All copy, UI text, communications, and documentation MUST follow these guidelines.

## 📋 Terminology

Use these specific terms consistently throughout the application:

### Primary Terms

| **Use This** | **Not This** | **Context** |
|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Club** | Program | Overarching description of what a customer is signing up for |
| **Member/Membership** | Customer, Subscriber | A signed-up customer |
| **Tier** | Stage, Level | Different membership levels (database uses "stages" - no need to change) |
| **Duration** | Expiration, Subscription Period | Time-based membership window |

### Duration-Specific Language

**Always use "duration" terminology:**
- ✅ Duration start
- ✅ Duration end (NOT "expiration date")
- ✅ Duration extension
- ✅ Tier duration
- ✅ Remaining duration
- ✅ Extend your duration

**Why?** "Expiration" connotes a hard end and loss of control. Duration emphasizes the timeframe members have to buy wine and extend their membership. Members should always feel in control.

## 🎯 Brand Identity

### Name & Meaning
- **LiberoVino** = "Liberate Wine"
- **Libero** = Liberate (Italian/Spanish)
- Core concept: **Liberation from traditional wine club bondage**

### Core Messaging

**Revolutionary Concept:**
- Members are **liberated** from traditional club constraints
- They have **freedom** to purchase when ready (within limits)
- They control their **own schedule and quantity**
- No forced shipments or predetermined schedules

**Use "liberate/liberation" everywhere appropriate:**
- "Liberate your wine buying"
- "Liberation from scheduled shipments"  
- "Free yourself to buy on your terms"
- "Liberated wine club experience"

---

## 📣 Tone & Voice

### Brand Personality
- **Empowering** - Members are in control
- **Revolutionary** - Challenging the status quo
- **Modern** - Fresh approach to wine clubs
- **Exciting** - Part of something new and innovative

### Communication Principles

1. **Emphasize Freedom vs. Obligation**
   - Traditional clubs: "You're **obligated** to accept shipments"
   - LiberoVino: "You're **liberated** to buy when you want"

2. **Focus on Benefits, Not Restrictions**
   - ❌ "You must buy $X by Y date"
   - ✅ "You have N months to enjoy your tier benefits"

3. **Member Control**
   - Members choose when to receive wine
   - Members decide how much to buy (within tier limits)
   - No surprises, no forced deliveries

---

## 🎁 Incentive Messaging

### Primary Motivators

All communication should center around:

1. **Tier Advancement**
   - "Move up to unlock better discounts"
   - "Higher tiers = more savings"
   - "Advance your tier to increase benefits"

2. **Loyalty Points** (after 1 year)
   - Points initiation at 1-year membership
   - Accumulation rewards long-term loyalty
   - "Your loyalty pays off - literally"

3. **Duration Extension**
   - "Extend your duration with each purchase"
   - "The more you buy, the longer your benefits last"
   - "Push your duration end date further out"

### The Core Difference

**Traditional Clubs:**
- Members buy **minimum required** only
- Everything predetermined by winery
- Scheduled shipments create wine overload
- #1 reason for opt-out: "Too much wine"

**LiberoVino:**
- Members buy **when they're ready**
- No attention needed on purchase tracking
- No forced schedules
- Extended duration = less worry about "when to buy next"
- **Freedom eliminates the #1 opt-out reason**

### Messaging Examples

✅ **Good:**
- "Buy wine when your cellar needs it, not when we schedule it"
- "Your next purchase extends your membership - stay liberated longer"
- "No surprise shipments, ever"
- "The more you buy, the higher your tier and the more you save"

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Your membership expires on..."
- "You're required to purchase..."
- "Club shipment scheduled for..."

## 🏷️ Branding Standards

### Co-Branding
- **Always** include LiberoVino branding alongside client (winery) branding
